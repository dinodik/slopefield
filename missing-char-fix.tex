% THIS FILE DOES NOT COMPILE

% Below is the original broken tex, with the erroneous lines highlighted.
% To fix it, 5 semicolons must be removed (3 are after \pgfmathsetmacro
% and 2 are at the end of \foreach blocks).

% If you are to copy-paste the FIXED lines into the existing document,
% make sure to ONLY copy the lines containing the \foreach blocks, because
% some example slope fields may use a different value for \numSlopes.
